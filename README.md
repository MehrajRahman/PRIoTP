# PRIoTP: A Novel Partial-Reliable Application Protocol for Internet of Things

## Overview

PRIoTP (Partial-Reliable Internet of Things Protocol) is a novel application-layer protocol designed specifically for Internet of Things (IoT) environments. The protocol addresses the fundamental trade-off between reliability and resource efficiency in IoT systems by introducing partial reliability mechanisms that allow applications to selectively trade off delivery guarantees for reduced computational overhead and improved bandwidth utilization.

Unlike traditional protocols that enforce all-or-nothing delivery semantics, PRIoTP enables fine-grained control over reliability requirements on a per-message basis, making it particularly suited for resource-constrained IoT devices and sensor networks where perfect reliability is neither necessary nor economically justifiable for all data streams.

## Key Features

- **Partial-Reliable Delivery Semantics**: Flexible delivery guarantees allowing applications to specify reliability requirements per message or flow
- **Congestion Control Mechanisms**: Adaptive congestion management optimized for IoT environments with heterogeneous network conditions
- **Efficient Message Encoding**: BSON-based serialization for compact and efficient message representation
- **Flow Management**: Sophisticated active flow monitoring and management for multi-source data aggregation
- **Fragment Buffering**: Intelligent packet fragmentation and reassembly for networks with limited MTU
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to support both client-server and publish-subscribe communication patterns

## Architecture

The PRIoTP implementation consists of several core modules:

- **Protocol Core**: Core protocol logic and state management
- **Message Encoding**: BSON-based message serialization and parsing
- **Congestion Control**: Adaptive algorithms for network resource management
- **Flow Management**: Active flow tracking and routing
- **Client Module**: Client-side protocol implementation
- **Application Layer**: Sample applications and testing harnesses

## Building and Installation

### Prerequisites

- C compiler (gcc or compatible)
- GNU Autotools (autoconf, automake, libtool)
- POSIX-compliant operating system
- libm (mathematics library)

### Compilation Steps

1. Navigate to the project root directory and run the configure script:

```bash
./configure
```

The configure script will check for available system features and dependencies. This process may take several minutes.

2. Compile the project using make:

```bash
make
```

3. Optionally, run the included test suite:

```bash
make check
```

4. Install the compiled binaries and libraries:

```bash
sudo make install
```

This step requires root privileges for system-wide installation. Alternatively, use `./configure --prefix=/path/to/install` during step 1 for local installation.

5. To verify successful installation, run the installation checks:

```bash
make installcheck
```

6. To clean the build artifacts:

```bash
make clean
```

To remove all generated configuration files:

```bash
make distclean
```

## Usage

### Starting the Test Environment

The protocol can be tested using the included sensor launcher and server components:

Terminal 1 - Start the sensor simulator and traffic generator:

```bash
python3 sensor-launcher.py localhost 5004 10 4 & python3 STGen_server.py ../conf/test.conf localhost 5004 5005 10
```

Terminal 2 - Launch the PRIoTP client:

```bash
./PRTP_client -l./client1_sensor_log -s127.0.0.1 -rtemp_1 -p5005 -A
```

### Configuration

The protocol can be configured via configuration files located in the `conf/` directory. Refer to sample configuration files for available parameters and tuning options.

## Experimental Evaluation

The `docs/eval/` directory contains comprehensive documentation of the protocol's experimental evaluation, including:

- Performance benchmarks and comparative analysis
